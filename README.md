# DO THIS FIRST

1. create a file called `.env` in the root of the project
2. add the following to the `.env` file:
```
export FQIN=your_fqin
```
where `your_fqin` is the fully qualified image name of the image you want to use for the container. For example, `your_fqin` could be `docker.io/your_username/your_image`.
